# QTC-chatroom-project
In this project, I create a QTCP chatroom.


TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable, stream-oriented, connection-oriented transport protocol.
It is especially well suited for continuous transmission of data. It is crucial for TCP-transmitted data to 
actually reach its destination. 

we use QTCP server class as a base for the server implementation & QTcpSocket for client implementation. for
accessing history chat databases, we use the QSqlDatabase class to represent history. In this chatroom, you 
can send text, image & any type of file with display sending rate.
